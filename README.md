Oh no! You took another L from your favorite FPS shooter game because your aim was not on point! You know that your not a bad player but you know your not the best either. You think that your aim needs to improve but don't know how. You came to a conclusion that you need to increase your reaction time and speed to get better aim so you can win more. This way you can always come out on top and win a bit more instead of losing so much!

# About the Game

The whole point of the game is to much sure your click your targets within in a set time. The targets appear in a set area. They do not stay in one spot forever. They appear randomly in an area. Every click on a target gets you a point. To get more points you need to click the target within a set time. To win the game, get enough points to beat the current score within a set time.

# Post Reflection

I wrote on paper to see my thoughts and ideas of how to approach this project. Then I kind of talked to myself on what steps would be needed. I currently understand that every step is very important for code so I wanted to make sure I did not miss a step if possible. Then I wrote small functions that would be needed for project. After testing it out to make sure it worked, I threw it all together to get my project to work. I struggled alot on getting all the timers to work properly because they would execute with a slight lag due to it being asynchronous code. Then some more issues popped up because some varibles were local/function scope. After some testing and experimenting I got my code to work properly. I used a lot of googling and peers for help with this project. After finishing this project, I feel a bit more confident with my coding. Just knowing that I was able to create something and getting it to work was amazing. Then I also had a lot of ah ha moments where I somehow found a solution or realized that I miss-spelled something.
