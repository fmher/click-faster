# click-faster

Oh no! You took another L from your favorite FPS shooter game because your aim was not on point! You know that your not a bad player but you know your not the best either. You think that your aim needs to improve but don't know how. You came to a conclusion that you need to increase your reaction time and speed to get better aim so you can win more. This way you can always come out on top and win a bit more instead of losing so much!
